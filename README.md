# Cuis-Smalltalk-JSON-Extensions

Not much to this:

Provides an extension method `asJsonObject` to convert an object into a form
that is easily serialized as JSON, because that is sometimes more convenient
than serializing directly to JSON.

Really, that's it.

It only exists as a standalone package because it is a dependency of various
other things I'm working on but also doesn't really belong to any of them.
